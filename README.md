# Mistral-ULM

Mistral transformer model adapted for the experiments in [Spoken Language Modeling with Duration-Penalized Self-Supervised Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23494).

The main transformer model is in `ulm/transformer.py`.

There are tokenizers and datasets for units (speech units) and phones (text-based).
